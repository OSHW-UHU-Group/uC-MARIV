microControlled Motorized Analytical Rotary Injection Valve

This is a project to make a low-pression injection valve for analytical purposes. The valve possition is controlled by a DC motor and an electronic controller specifically designed.
An one-button opperation can swapp the valve settings. The opperation can be remotelly performed and a microcontroler can be used to synchronize the opperation with other devices.
